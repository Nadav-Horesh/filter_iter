===========
* cython callbak: Is it possible to to automatic dtype inference without a
  significan speed penalty?
* callback call loop with prange.
* Initialisation code for the C callback (similar to to the cython callback
  class __init__ method)
* Extend to support all non-complex dtypes


Distant dreams
==============
* Enable output dtype different from the input's
* Bypass the ugly use of ctypes and the assumption of pointer == unsigned
  long
