0.0.1

* Added a cython convolution kernel (need help to make it operational, see
  demo/example_not_working.py)
* C kernel: The C kernel can ow be called directly, no need to provide
  a pointer to a kernel function.
* The data for the kernel is now copied with using python --- opens the way
  to run kernel in a parallel loop.
